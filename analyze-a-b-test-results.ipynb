The goal is to use **statsmodels** to fit the regression model you specified in part **a.** to see if there is a significant difference in conversion based on which page a customer receives. However, first need to create in df2 a column for the intercept, and create a dummy variable column for which page each user received.  Add an **intercept** column, as well as an **ab_page** column, which is 1 when an individual receives the **treatment** and 0 if **control**."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":32,"id":"63013abc","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2022-04-06T17:39:57.140488Z","iopub.status.busy":"2022-04-06T17:39:57.139794Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-04-06T17:39:57.19723Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-04-06T17:39:57.197739Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-04-06T09:38:30.446872Z"},"papermill":{"duration":0.144964,"end_time":"2022-04-06T17:39:57.197911","exception":false,"start_time":"2022-04-06T17:39:57.052947","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/html":["<div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>user_id</th>\n","      <th>timestamp</th>\n","      <th>group</th>\n","      <th>converted</th>\n","      <th>intercept</th>\n","      <th>ab_page</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>0</th>\n","      <td>851104</td>\n","      <td>2017-01-21 22:11:48.556739</td>\n","      <td>control</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>1</th>\n","      <td>804228</td>\n","      <td>2017-01-12 08:01:45.159739</td>\n","      <td>control</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>2</th>\n","      <td>661590</td>\n","      <td>2017-01-11 16:55:06.154213</td>\n","      <td>treatment</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>3</th>\n","      <td>853541</td>\n","      <td>2017-01-08 18:28:03.143765</td>\n","      <td>treatment</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>4</th>\n","      <td>864975</td>\n","      <td>2017-01-21 01:52:26.210827</td>\n","      <td>control</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","    </tr>\n","  </tbody>\n","</table>\n","</div>"],"text/plain":["   user_id                   timestamp      group  converted  intercept  \\\n","0   851104  2017-01-21 22:11:48.556739    control          0          1   \n","1   804228  2017-01-12 08:01:45.159739    control          0          1   \n","2   661590  2017-01-11 16:55:06.154213  treatment          0          1   \n","3   853541  2017-01-08 18:28:03.143765  treatment          0          1   \n","4   864975  2017-01-21 01:52:26.210827    control          1          1   \n","\n","   ab_page  \n","0        0  \n","1        0  \n","2        1  \n","3        1  \n","4        0  "]},"execution_count":32,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["# Adding an intercept column\n","df2['intercept'] = 1\n","\n","# Get tow dummies of landing page and drop it and one of the tow to get full rank with baseline columns\n","df2[['ab_page', 'other_page']] = pd.get_dummies(df2['landing_page'])\n","df2.drop(columns=['landing_page', 'other_page'], inplace=True)\n","df2.head()"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"b1d8bbc6","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.075791,"end_time":"2022-04-06T17:39:57.349861","exception":false,"start_time":"2022-04-06T17:39:57.27407","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["c.
